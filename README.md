### Lab 10.4: Dynamic Routing

Build a small but feature-rich blog application that demonstrates dynamic routing and basic authentication.

#### Overview

The app will:

- Display a list of blog posts.
- Allow navigation to individual post pages via dynamic routes.
- Include a protected admin area accessible only to logged-in users.
- Manage authentication state using React Context.

#### Features

This lab provides hands-on experience with:

- React Router
- URL parameters
- Conditional rendering
- Client-side authentication
- Protected routes

#### Learning Objectives

- Implement dynamic routes in React Router.
- Create a main index page linking to multiple dynamic detail pages.
- Read and use route parameters to fetch and display specific data.
- Structure a basic client-side authentication system with React Context.
- Create protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users.
- Conditionally render UI elements based on authentication status.
